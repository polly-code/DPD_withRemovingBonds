# Dissipative particle dynamics to reproduce conformation

This implementation of DPD is based on the repository (https://github.com/KPavelI/dpd) which was used for the simulation chromatin interactions with the nuclear lamina [1].

## Hardaware requirements

The RAM, HDD and CPU are depend on the system size and available simulation time. Current calculations were performed on cluster lomonosov-2 [2], for each run we used 56 cores.

## Software requirements

Fortran90 compiler. The software has been tested on the following systems: `Ubuntu 16.04`, `CentOS Linux` (release 7.1.1503).

## General notes

To visualize output restart files you may convert it to **mol2** using `rst2mol2.py` from the mentioned [repository](https://github.com/KPavelI/dpd) from example folder. If you are using this code, please, cite the folowing works [3, 4].
